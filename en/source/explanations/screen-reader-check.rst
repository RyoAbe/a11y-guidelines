How to Perform Checks with Screen Readers
#########################################

Here, we will explain the recommended settings and essential knowledge for checking with major screen readers.

At freee, we conduct accessibility checks using screen readers according to the following policy:

For PC Web:
   *  Verify functionality with NVDA and Google Chrome on Windows, and consider the check result as FAIL if it does not function.
   *  Limit checks with macOS VoiceOver to static content and UI components that have already been verified with NVDA; perform other checks with NVDA.
For Mobile Applications:
   *  Verify functionality with iOS VoiceOver and Android TalkBack; consider the check result as FAIL if it does not function.
