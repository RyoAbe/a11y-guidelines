The Role of Wording in Text Information and Accessibility
#########################################################

The extent to which text information is comprehensible to a broad audience depends on the wording used.
Naturally, it is essential to strive for clear expressions and consistent notation; however, these are pre-requisites to accessibility concerns.
To maintain text quality above a certain level, it would be beneficial to establish separate writing guidelines.

*************************************
Sensory Perceptions and Accessibility
*************************************

From an accessibility perspective, it is particularly important not to solely use expressions that assume specific sensory perceptions.

For example, consider the text "Click the red icon."
If there is only one red icon on the screen, this description might be sufficient and the clearest explanation for most people.
However, users with color vision deficiencies might not be able to distinguish it from other icons of the same shape but different colors.
Moreover, this description is likely to be completely ineffective for users of screen readers.

However, this doesn't mean that such expressions should be completely avoided.
There's no problem as long as expressions are supplemented with descriptions that are easier for everyone to understand.
In this case, not just relying on the color of the icon but also providing additional information such as its shape, position on the screen, and any text labels associated with the icon can help avoid this issue.

******************************
Clarity in Headings and Labels
******************************

Another crucial aspect of the wording in text information is ensuring that the text used for headings and labels is clear and understandable.
When appropriate terms are used for headings, it becomes easier to determine whether the information in that section is relevant or not.
This is particularly important for users of screen readers.

Similarly, using clear and precise language for labels helps accurately convey the purpose of a component or form control.

Clear wording in text information aids all users, but especially those who rely on assistive technologies, in navigating and understanding the content more effectively.
